## Instructions to create build manually:

For **Android**, run:

```
react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res/
```

```
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

For **iOS**, run:

```
react-native run-ios --configuration=release
```

to get the `.app` file in `Build/Products/Release/"<Your_Filename>.app"`. For conversion from `.app` to `.ipa`:
